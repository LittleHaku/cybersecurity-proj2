This project's goal is to learn how to compromise a virtual machine that is running Metasploitable 3 and Snort to detect possible attacks, the Snort rules that I used were the ones that are given in the snort.conf file in the course. Five attacks will be performed, three of them will be recognized by Snort, but the other two will not be identified.

Before doing any attack, we must first obtain the open ports of the machine, for this, we will use the tool Nmap, which will let us see which ports are open and which services are running on them.

First, we execute the basic Nmap command:

nmap -sV 172.28.128.3

We get the ports that are open and the services that are running, but we then try with a more in-depth analysis:

sudo nmap -n -sS -sV -sC 172.28.128.3 -p0-65535 -T4 -A -O

With this command we perform an in-depth analysis of all the ports, the main difference is that apart from getting the ports 3500 and 6697 which previously we did not get, we also saw the name of files that are in each of the services.

The output of the command can be seen in the repository, since we have to stay within the word limit I will not include outputs here.

Identified Attack 1: ProFTPd

Port 21 is open and running ProFTPd 1.3.5, so the first thing we do is search in Metasploit for scripts that match the service and version. From the list we select "exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec" due to its excellent rank and coincidence with version 1.3.5, we configure its options and run the exploit to see that it failed. Then we try to use a different payload "cmd/unix/reverse_perl" and repeat. This time the exploit works and we get a shell.

With the obtained shell, we see the different files that are in the directory and we see a file named "payroll_app.php" which we examine and see that it contains a chunk of code that validates the user and password, so we now have some credentials that may be useful later (root:sploitme).

Also, we can see that the attack was detected by Snort as a priority 1 attack:

11/16-16:31:14.340657  [**] [1:1356:5] WEB-ATTACKS perl execution attempt [**] [Classification: Web Application Attack] [Priority: 1] {TCP} 172.28.128.1:40327 -> 172.28.128.3:80
